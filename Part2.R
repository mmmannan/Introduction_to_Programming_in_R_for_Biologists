# Define the variable vegas

#->
vegas <- "Go!" 

#Great! Head over to the next exercise.


##Create Vector 2

numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector

#->
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE )
  
  
#Perfect! Notice that adding a space behind the commas in the 
#c() function improves the readability of your code. Let's practice 
#some more with vector creation in the next exercise.
  
##Creating Vectors 3
  
  
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
#roulette_vector <-  
#->
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)


##Very good! To check out the contents of your vectors, 
#remember that you can always simply type the variable in 
#the console and hit Enter. Proceed to the next exercise!


##Naming a vector

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
#->
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

##Well done! Continue to the next exercise.

##Naming Vector 2

#Nice one! A word of advice: try to avoid code duplication at all times. 
#Continue to the next exercise and learn how to do arithmetic with vectors!
  
#Calculating total winning

# Print out total_vector
  
total_vector

#Good job! Continue to the next exercise.

##Calculating total winning 2

##Great! Continue to the next exercise.
  
  
##Calculating total winning 3

###Well done. This is pretty bad news…
  
  
#Comparing Total winnings

names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Calculate total gains for poker and roulette
#->
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)
total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)
  
# Check if you realized higher total gains in poker than in roulette 
  
total_poker > total_roulette

#Good job! Continue to the next exercise

##Vector selection:: the good times


# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:

# Define a new variable based on a selection

#->
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]
  
  
##Great! R also makes it possible to select multiple elements from a vector at 
#once. Learn how in the next exercise!
  
###Vector Selection:: The good times 2
  
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:

# Define a new variable based on a selection

#->
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2,3,4)]
  
 
##Well done! Continue to the next exercise to specialize in vector 
#selection some more!

#Awesome! The colon operator is extremely useful and very often used in R programming, so 
#remember it well. Proceed to the next exercise.
  
# Vector Selection: The good times 4

poker_start <- poker_vector[c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")]
  
# Calculate the average of the elements in poker_start

##Good job! Apart from subsetting vectors by index or by name, you can also subset vectors 
#by comparison. The next exercises will show you how!
  
##Selection  by comparison step 1

# Which days did you make money on poker?

#->
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0
  
# Print out selection_vector
#->

##Great!
  
##Selection By comparison Step 2
  
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:

#Good job! Continue to the next exercise.
  
  
##Advanced Selection

#Great! This exercise concludes the chapter on vectors. The next chapter will introduce you 
#to the two-dimensional version of vectors: matrices.
