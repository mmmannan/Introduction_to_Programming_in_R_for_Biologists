##Good job! Ready to start? Continue to the next exercise!


##What's a factor and why would you use it? (2)

# Sex vector
sex_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")

# Convert sex_vector to a factor

factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)
# Print out factor_sex_vector

factor_sex_vector  
  
##Great! If you want to find out more about the factor() function, do not hesitate to type 
#?factor in the console. This will open up a help page. Continue to the next exercise.

# Animals
animals_vector <- c("Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey", "Horse")
factor_animals_vector <- factor(animals_vector)

# Temperature
temperature_vector <- c("High", "Low", "High","Low", "Medium")

#Can you already tell what's happening in this exercise? Awesome! Continue to the next exercise and get into 
#the details of factor levels.


#Factor Levels

# Code to build factor_survey_vector
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
factor_survey_vector
# Specify the levels of factor_survey_vector
#levels(factor_survey_vector) <-

levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
#  factor_survey_vector
#->
factor_survey_vector

#Wonderful! Proceed to the next exercise

###Summarizing size factor

# Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
factor_survey_vector

# Generate summary for survey_vector
#->
summary(survey_vector)

# Generate summary for factor_survey_vector
#->
summary(factor_survey_vector) 

##Nice! Have a look at the output. The fact that you identified 
#"Male" and "Female" as factor levels in factor_survey_vector enables
#R to show the number of elements for each category.
